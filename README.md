Advent of Code Solutions
========================

ðŸŽ„âŒ¨ [Advent Of Code][1] was created by [Eric Wastl][2] to offer 25 days of holiday-themed programming puzzles intended to be appropriate for both novices and adepts alike. He may have made [his solutions][3] in PHP, but I forgive him. I rather enjoyed working on them and learned a lot. I thought I'd share my solutions. Hopefully they'll prove useful to others, as well. Feel free to leave issues, as there's always more to learn.

So far, I've been doing things in `bash`, but am thinking about Clojure and maybe seeing how far I can get with nothing but `awk`.
